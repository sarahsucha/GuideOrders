## Currency Exchange
* In the model, calculate the conversion
* In the
* helper methods for how much sold for vs. worth
* chron job / cron job for currency api update
* When does the API update (and run the chron shortly after that)
* if the rate stays the same for that specific conversion rate, extend the valid-through date.
* if it's different, create a new row for the czk conversion for that currency type

## Recon Report
* Be default closed is false
* create a new entry once the latest entry is true
* automatically track any new orders to latest recon report

Have someone look at routes to make sure they are RESTful
